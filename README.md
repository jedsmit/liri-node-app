# liri-node-app

Liri is a command line app that takes in search terms and returns results from various APIs. Liri has four main functions: concert-this, movie-this, spotify-this-song, and do-what-it-says. This is a node app, so the user begins by typing the following into the command line: `node liri.js` followed by two arguments. The first tells Liri which function to use and the second is the search term.  Here's a description of each function and what they do:
